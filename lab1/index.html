				<p>You're going to be setting up your workspace. By the end of this activity, you should have a workspace in your desktop that looks something like this:</p>
				<img src="assets/img/desktop.png" />
				<br>
				<p>You're also going to make a website using HTML! You will use the tags we learned about today. By the end, you should have a basic site that looks something like this:</p>

				<div class = "body-header">Step 1: Setting up your workspace</div>
					<p>Navigate to a folder in your desktop where you would like to store this handson. (As you can see in the example above, I just set it up in a folder called "workspace") Create a folder called <b>handson1</b>. We will store everything we need for this website in that folder. 
					</p>
					<p>Now, navigate into your <b>handson1</b> folder, and create a folder called <b>assets</b>. Remember, this is where we will store our CSS and Javascript files, as well as images and any additional files. 
					</p>
					<p>Navigate into the <b>assets</b> folder, and create two new folders: one titled <b>css</b>, and one titled <b>img</b>. We won't be adding any CSS styles in this activity (that's for tomorrow!), but we will be inserting an image. 
					</p>
					<p>Either find an existing image on your computer, or Google Search for an image of your favorite animal. Copy it into the <b>img</b> folder you just created. We will be adding this to our HTML site later.
					</p>
					<p>Open up your text editor, and create a new file. Before you do anything else, save this file in your <b>handson1</b> folder as <b>index.html</b> (Note: this should be saved on the <em>same level</em> as your "assets" folder - not inside of it!).
					</p>
					<p>Now, you should have a workspace that looks something like this:
					</p>
					<img src="assets/img/desktop.png">
					<br><br>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 2: Structuring your file</div>
					<p>Setting up your HTML file correctly is important - if you don't do it right, you won't have a working website!
					</p>
					<p>You should still have your <b>index.html</b> file open in your text editor. Declare this page as an HTML file, then set it up as an HTML document.
					</p>
					<p>Add a title to your site! In the <b>head</b> of your HTML file, add the title <b>My First Website</b>
					</p>

					<p> Navigate to your workspace on your desktop (open the folder <b>handson1</b>) and open up your <b>index.html</b> file in Google Chrome. You shouldn't see any content on your website, but check that the tab in your window has the title you've just added.
					</p>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 3: Adding a heading</div>
					<p> HTML has tags that allow you to create headings of different sizes. On the first line inside the <b>body</b> of your file, add your favorite food, and make it a heading of the largest possible size.
					</p>
					<p><em>Hint: The heading tags are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6.</em>
					</p>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 4: Adding a subheading</div>
					<p>Now you want to add a subheading that is slightly smaller than your heading. On the next line, add your favorite song at the moment, and make it a heading of the next largest size.
					</p>
					<p>Refresh your site on Google Chrome. You should now see something that looks like this:
					</p>
					<img src="assets/img/step4.jpg" style="width: 75%;"><br><br>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 5: Adding a link</div>
					<p>On the next line, write <b>This site is dope</b>, and make it so that <b>This site</b> links to a website you think is really cool.
					</p>
					<p>
					</p>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 6: Adding a paragraph</div>
					<p>HTML ignores white space: in other words, adding extra lines between text in your  HTML file won't actually translate to line separations on your website. In order to create space between paragraphs, you will have to use a specific HTML tag.
					</p>
					<p>Right under your website link, create a paragraph using the correct HTML tag.  Write a sentence or two explaining why you like the website. To fill the rest of your paragraph, add some filler text (A lot of web designers will use what's called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lipsum.com/">"Lorem ipsum" text</a> as dummy text).
					</p>
					<p>
					 If you're using Sublime as your text editor, you can just type the word "lorem", then press the Tab button. It should generate a paragraph of lorem ipsum! (Otherwise, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://mashable.com/2013/07/11/lorem-ipsum/">these</a> fun lorem ipsum generators if you want to mix things up.)
					</p>
					<p>Go back to Google Chrome, where your website should be open. Refresh the page - and your site should now look like this:</p>
					<img src="assets/img/step6.jpg" style="width: 75%;"><br><br>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 7: Adding an image</div>
					<p>Remember the image we saved in our <b>img</b> folder? Add this image under your paragraph. Because it's a local folder stored on your desktop, you want to use a relative path.
					</p>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 8: Adding an unordered list</div>
					<p>Create a new container. <em>(Hint: use the <b>div</b> tag!)</em><br>
					Inside this container, create a span that says "Semester goals:". <em>(Hint: <b>span</b> tag!)</em>
					</p>
					<p>Under this span (still inside the div), create a bulleted list of at least three goals you have for yourself this semester. (They can be as silly as you want) Think about what tags you can use to do this. Your site should now look like this:
					</p>
					</p>
					<p>You're done! Your site should look like this:</p>
					<img src="assets/img/step8.jpg" style="width: 75%;"><br><br>
