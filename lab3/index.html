					<div class="info-intro">In	this hands-on	session,	we	will	create	a	basic	one-page	scroll	landing	page.	When	you	open	up	index.html,	you	will	see	that	the	
document	is	roughly	divided	into	5	“slides”	– cover,	reach,	discover,	engage,	and	
footer.	We	will	tackle	the	cover	section	first,	then	go	on	to	the	three	content	slides	
(reach,	discover,	engage),	and	wrap	up	with	the	footer.</div>
				</div>

			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>Our final product will look like this:</p>
				<img src="assets/img/demo.jpg"><br><br><br><div class = "body-header">Step 1: Cover</div>
					<p>The	cover	slide	is	divided	into	three	parts	– the	background,	the	content,	and	the	
navigation.	We	will	try	to	put	the	content	and	the	navigation	on	top	of the	
background. 
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li><h4>Background</h4> First,	let’s	adjust	the	size	of	the	background.	Add	“width:	100%;	height:	
500px;”	to #cover-background	so	that	it	doesn’t	cover	the	entire	screen.</li>
						<li><h4>Content</h4> We	can	now	proceed	to	the	content.	We	will	eventually	vertically	center	
the	content,	but	first	let’s	assign	it	an	arbitrary	position.	Since	the	content	
goes	on	top	of background,	add	“position:	absolute;	width:	100%;	top:	
60px;”	to	#cover-content.
We	have	“width:	100%;”	because	setting	“position:	absolute”	will	remove	a	
div	tag’s	natural	property	of	taking	up	as	much	width	as	possible	(which	is	
typically	your	entire	browser	width.)	As	such,	we	need	to	explicitly	state	
that	#header	should	take	up	the	entire	width.</li>
						<li><h4>Typography</h4> Let’s	adjust	some	typography	by	adding	“text-align:	center;	color:	
white;”	to	#cover-content,	“font-size:	36px;	font-weight:	300;”	to	
#cover-title,	and	“font-size:	16px;	font-weight:	300;	color:	rgba(255,	
255,	255,	0.5);	margin-top:	10px;” to	#cover-subtitle.
“Color:	rgba(255,	255,	255,	0.5)”	will	set	the	color	of	the	subtitle	to	be	white,	
but	with	50%	opacity,	making	it	look	semi-transparent.</li>
						<li><h4>Breathing space</h4> If	you	hover	over	#cover-content,	you	will see	that	its	height	is	81px.	To	
vertically	center	this	element,	change	the	value	of	its	“top”	property	to	
“50%,”	and	add	“margin-top:	-40px;”	which	will	push	this	element	
upward	by	roughly	half	of	its	height.</li>
						<li><h4>Navigation</h4> Moving	on	to	navigation.	For	this	website,	we will	have	a	navigation	that	
will	stick	to	the	bottom	of	the	cover.	As	such,	we	will	give	it	“position:	
absolute;	bottom:	0px;	width:	100%;”	to	#cover-nav.	This	will	put	the	
navigation	on	top	of	the	cover,	and	stick	it	to	the	bottom.</li>
						<li><h4>Navigation Background</h4> Let’s	give	the	navigation	more	emphasis,	separating	it	from	the	rest	of	the	
content,	by	adding	“background:	rgba(255,	255,	255,	0.2)	color:	white;	
padding:	20px	0px;”	to	#cover-nav.	This	will	change	the	background	to	
20%	opacity	white,	change	the	font	color	to	white,	and	add	vertical	inner	
spacing	of	20px.</li>
						<li><h4>Navigation Width</h4> Notice	that	the	content	is	touching	the	edge	of	the	screen.	Add	“width:	
960px;	margin	0px	auto;”	to	#cover-nav-content.	This	will	add	a	
maximum	width	for	the	content	inside	the	navigation.</li>
						<li><h4>Alignment</h4> We	are	now	ready	to	align	elements	horizontally.	Add	“float:	left”	to	
#cover-nav-title	to	put	the	title	to	the	left	edge,	and	add	“float:	right”	to	
.cover-nav-item to	put	the	navigation	items	to	the	right	edge.
We	have	.clear	elements	with	“clear:	both”	CSS	properties	attached	to	them	
at	the	end	of	a	series	of	floated	elements.	This	is	because	you	must	add	
“clear:	both”	at	the	end	of	a	series	of	horizontally	stacked	elements;	
otherwise,	the	browser	will	continue	to	stack	elements	horizontally.	
Consider	.clear	elements	as	“period	marks.”</li>
						<li><h4>More Typography</h4> For	some	final	touch,	let’s	tweak	the	typography	by	adding	“font-weight:	
700;”	to	#cover-nav-title	and	adding	“font-size:	13px;	line-height:	22px;
margin-left:	30px;”	to	.nav-item.
We	add	“line-height:	22px;”	because	we	must	make	sure	that	the	text	on	
.nav-item	align	properly	with	the	title’s	font-size.	If	you	hover	over	#title	
from	web	inspector,	you	can	see	that	it	takes	up	a	height	of	22px.</li>
						<li><h4>Navigation Position</h4> Try	to	scroll	your	website.	You	will	see	that	the	navigation	bar	scrolls	
along	with	the	website.	We	want	the	navigation	bar	to	be	fixed	to	that	
position.	So	yes,	you	should	add	“position:	fixed;	width:	100%;”	to	
#header.
We	have	“width:	100%;”	because	setting	“position:	fixed”	will	remove	a	div	
tag’s	natural	property	of	taking	up	as	much	width	as	possible	(which	is	
typically	your	entire	browser	width.)	As	such,	we	need	to	explicitly	state	
that	#header	should	take	up	the	entire	width.</li>
					</ol>
					<br><br>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 2: Content</div>
					<p>Whew!	Now	things	will	get	a	little	easier.	Here,	we	will	tweak	the	content	– notice	
that	we	assigned	these	content	slides	a	class	of	“.slide”	and	ids	of	“#reach,	#discover,	
#engage.”	We	will	use	ids	to	assign	CSS	attributes	unique	to	each	slide,	and	use	.slide	
class	to	assign	CSS	attribute	that	apply	to	all	three	of	the	slides.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>As	always,	you	almost	never	want	your	content	to	touch	the	edges.	
Since	this	is	a	landing	page,	let’s	give	ample	vertical	spacing	by	adding	
“padding:	60px	0px;”	to	.slide.	Then,	give	each	slide	unique	
background	color	by	adding	“background:	#1abc9c;”	to	#reach,	“background:	#3498db”	to	#discover,	and	“background:	#de6868;”	to	
#engage.</li>
						<li>Let’s	set	the	maximum	width	of	the	content	by	adding	“width:	720px;	
margin:	0px	auto;”	to	.container.</li>
						<li>The	thumbnail	picture	looks	quite	bad	right	now.	Let’s	give	it	some	
CSS	magic	by	adding	following	properties	to	.slide-thumbnail:
						<ul>
							<li>“width:	240px;	height:	240px;”	– Adjusts	the	size</li>
							<li>“margin:	0px	auto”	– Horizontal	center</li>
							<li>“border-radius:	50%;	overflow:	hidden;”	– Change	to	circle</li>
							<li>“border:	10px	solid	rgba(255,	255,	255,	0.5)”	– Add	50%	
opacity	white	border	around	the	circle.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Now	let’s	adjust	some	typography.	Improve	the	contrast	and	center	
the	text	by	adding	“text-align:	center;	color:	white;”	to	.container	to	
apply	the	changes	to	all	the	text	inside	the	slide.	Then,	add	“font-size:	
24px;	font-weight:	300;	margin-top:	20px;”	to	.slide-title	and	add	
“font-size:	13px;	line-height:	24px;	margin-top:	20px;”	to	.slidedescription.
</li>
					</ol>
					<br><br>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 2: Footer</div>
				<p>For	the	very	last	touch,	add	“background:	#2f353f;	padding:	10px	0px;	font-size:	
12px;	font-weight:	700;	text-align:	center;	color:	white;”	to	#footer.	By	now,	you	
should	understand	what	each	of	these	CSS	properties	would do.	</p>
				<p>You	are	all	set!	You	can	now	gaze	at	the	beauty	you	created	all	you	want </p>
